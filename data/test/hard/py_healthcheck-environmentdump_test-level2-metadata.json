Its primary function is to generate structured JSON output detailing runtime system information, including custom-defined sections and sanitized environment variables, ensuring sensitive data is not exposed. The module enables developers to define and integrate custom diagnostic sections, making it highly extensible for application-specific use cases. This addresses the need for an easily consumable and secure mechanism to inspect application states and runtime environments, aiding in debugging, monitoring, and compliance efforts.\n\n## FILE 1: healthcheck/environmentdump.py\n\n- CLASS METHOD: EnvironmentDump.run\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class EnvironmentDump:\n  - SIGNATURE: def run(self):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nRuns the environment dump by executing registered functions and returning their results as a JSON string.\n\nThis method iterates over all functions stored in the `self.functions` dictionary, calls each function, and collects their outputs. The results are then serialized into JSON format and returned alongside an HTTP status code (200) and a content type header indicating the response type as 'application/json'.\n\nReturns:\n    A tuple containing:\n        - A JSON string of the collected environment data.\n        - An integer status code (200).\n        - A dictionary with the content type header.\n\nDependencies:\n    - Utilizes the `six` library for compatibility between Python 2 and 3 when iterating over the `self.functions` dictionary, which is populated based on the constructor's parameters.\n    - Functions such as `get_os`, `get_python`, and `get_process` are dynamically added to `self.functions` during initialization, and their output shapes the final response.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n- CLASS METHOD: EnvironmentDump.__init__\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class EnvironmentDump:\n  - SIGNATURE: def __init__(self, include_os=True, include_python=True, include_process=True, **kwargs):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nInitializes an instance of the EnvironmentDump class, which collects various environmental data such as OS, Python, and process information.\n\nParameters:\n- include_os (bool): If True, includes operating system information. Default is True.\n- include_python (bool): If True, includes Python environment details. Default is True.\n- include_process (bool): If True, includes process information. Default is True.\n- **kwargs: Additional sections to include, where the key is the section name and the value is a callable to get that data.\n\nThis constructor sets up a dictionary to hold functions that gather the specified environmental information. It conditionally adds methods to retrieve OS, Python, and process data based on the boolean flags. It also allows for the addition of custom data gathering functions through kwargs, ensuring they don't overwrite the default sections. The `add_section` method is used to incorporate these custom sections, ensuring their names are unique.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n- CLASS METHOD: EnvironmentDump.add_section\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class EnvironmentDump:\n  - SIGNATURE: def add_section(self, name, func):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nAdds a custom section to the environment dump by associating a name with a callable function. If the name already exists in the collection of functions, an exception is raised to prevent overwriting. If the provided `func` is not callable, it is stored as a lambda function returning the value instead.\n\nParameters:\n- name (Any): The name under which the section will be stored. It must be unique to avoid conflicts.\n- func (Callable): A callable object (function) to retrieve data for the custom section. If non-callable, it is stored as a constant value.\n\nReturns:\n- None: This method alters the internal state of the `EnvironmentDump` instance by adding the new section to the `self.functions` dictionary.\n\nRaises:\n- Exception: If `name` is already present in `self.functions`.\n\nDependencies:\n- Interacts with the `self.functions` attribute, which is a dictionary mapping section names to their corresponding data-fetching functions. The `add_section` method is a crucial part of extending the EnvironmentDump functionality, allowing users to dynamically include additional data sections.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n- CLASS METHOD: EnvironmentDump.get_process\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class EnvironmentDump:\n  - SIGNATURE: def get_process(self):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nRetrieves information about the current process, including command-line arguments, current working directory, user information, process ID, and environment variables.\n\nReturns:\n    Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the following keys:\n        - 'argv': List of command-line arguments passed to the Python script (sys.argv).\n        - 'cwd': Current working directory (os.getcwd()).\n        - 'user': The username of the person running the process, retrieved via the get_login() method that checks platform-specific methods.\n        - 'pid': Process ID of the current Python process (os.getpid()).\n        - 'environ': A safe representation of the environment variables (safe_dict(os.environ)).\n\nDependencies:\n- `sys`: for accessing command-line arguments and process ID.\n- `os`: for determining the current working directory and accessing environment variables.\n- `safe_dict`: a function imported from the security module to safely handle environment variables.\n- `get_login`: a method in this class that retrieves the username based on the underlying operating system.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n- CLASS METHOD: EnvironmentDump.get_python\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class EnvironmentDump:\n  - SIGNATURE: def get_python(self):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nRetrieve Python runtime information including version, executable location, PYTHONPATH, and installed packages.\n\nThis method gathers details about the current Python environment such as its version (using `sys.version`), executable path (`sys.executable`), the list of directories in PYTHONPATH (`sys.path`), and structured version information (`sys.version_info`). It also attempts to import the `pip` module to list all installed packages and their versions through `pip.get_installed_distributions()`. If the `pip` module is not available, it gracefully handles the `AttributeError` and simply returns the other information.\n\nReturns:\n    Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing:\n        - 'version': Full Python version string.\n        - 'executable': Path to the Python interpreter executable.\n        - 'pythonpath': List of paths where Python looks for packages.\n        - 'version_info': A dictionary with major, minor, micro version numbers, release level, and serial.\n        - 'packages': (optional) A dictionary of installed packages with their versions if `pip` is available.\n\nDependencies:\n    - `sys`: Standard module used to access Python runtime information.\n    - `pip`: Optional module for package management; its availability is checked during method execution.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n- CLASS METHOD: EnvironmentDump.get_os\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class EnvironmentDump:\n  - SIGNATURE: def get_os(self):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nRetrieves information about the operating system.\n\nThis method collects data related to the current operating system, including the platform name, \nthe OS name, and system information using the `platform.uname()` function. It does not take any \nparameters. \n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing:\n        - 'platform' (str): The platform identifier from `sys.platform`.\n        - 'name' (str): The name of the operating system from `os.name`.\n        - 'uname' (tuple): System information such as the processor, version, and release from \n          `platform.uname()`.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n# TASK DESCRIPTION:\nIn this project, you need to implement the functions and methods listed above.
