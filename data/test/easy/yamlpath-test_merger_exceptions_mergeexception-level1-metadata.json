It provides functionality to ensure that meaningful error messages are generated in scenarios where a merge operation fails, with or without additional path context. By simulating and verifying exception scenarios, this module helps developers quickly identify and diagnose YAML-related merge issues, ensuring robust error handling and improving the reliability of applications that rely on precise YAML data manipulation.\n\n## FILE 1: yamlpath/merger/exceptions/mergeexception.py\n\n- CLASS METHOD: MergeException.__init__\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class MergeException(Exception):\n  - SIGNATURE: def __init__(self, user_message: str, yaml_path: Optional[Union[YAMLPath, str]]=None) -> None:\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nInitialize a MergeException with a user-defined message and an optional YAML path indicating the location of the issue in the document.\n\nParameters:\n- user_message (str): A message intended to inform the user about the problem encountered during the document merge.\n- yaml_path (Optional[Union[YAMLPath, str]]): An optional parameter that specifies the exact location within the document (as a YAMLPath object or string) where the issue was detected.

The functions have been removed from the code but their docstrings remain.\nYour task is to:\n1. Read and understand the docstrings of each function/method\n2. Understand the dependencies and how they interact with the target functions\n3. Implement the functions/methods according to their docstrings and signatures\n4. Ensure your implementations work correctly with the rest of the codebase\n",
