It provides functionality to deserialize, instantiate, and validate FHIR Evidence resource objects, ensuring they adhere to the specification's structural and data integrity standards. This enables users or developers working with clinical reasoning or evidence-based data to reliably validate and access structured information, including metadata, status, and textual representation of evidence resources. By enabling streamlined interaction with FHIR resources, the module addresses the need for standardized validation and test automation, improving the robustness and reliability of applications that integrate with FHIR-based healthcare systems.\n\n## FILE 1: fhirclient/models/fhirabstractresource.py\n\n- CLASS METHOD: FHIRAbstractResource.as_json\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class FHIRAbstractResource(fhirabstractbase.FHIRAbstractBase):\n  - SIGNATURE: def as_json(self):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nReturns a JSON representation of the FHIR resource, including its resource type. This method overrides the `as_json` method of the superclass `FHIRAbstractBase`. It adds the `resourceType` key to the JSON output, setting its value to the class's `resource_type`, which is defined as 'FHIRAbstractResource'.\n\n:returns: A dictionary containing the JSON representation of the FHIR resource, including an additional key 'resourceType' indicating the type of the resource.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## FILE 2: fhirclient/models/evidence.py\n\n- CLASS METHOD: Evidence.__init__\n  - CLASS SIGNATURE: class Evidence(domainresource.DomainResource):\n  - SIGNATURE: def __init__(self, jsondict=None, strict=True):\n  - DOCSTRING: \n```python\n\"\"\"\nInitialize an Evidence resource, which represents a research context or question related to conditional states and outcomes.\n\nParameters:\n- jsondict (dict, optional): A JSON dictionary used for initializing the Evidence instance, mapping to the properties outlined in the class. If provided, it must contain valid keys as defined in FHIR specifications.\n- strict (bool, optional): When set to True (default), raises a FHIRValidationError for any invalid variables; if False, allows for some leniency in validation.\n\nAttributes initialized:\n- approvalDate (FHIRDate): Date when the evidence was approved by the publisher.\n- author (list of ContactDetail): Individuals or organizations who authored the content.\n- contact (list of ContactDetail): Contact details for the publisher.\n- copyright (str): Use and/or publishing restrictions.\n- date (FHIRDateTime): Date when the evidence was last changed.\n- description (str): Natural language description of the evidence.\n- editor (list of ContactDetail): Individuals or organizations who edited the content.\n- effectivePeriod (Period): Time frame during which the evidence is expected to be used.\n- endorser (list of ContactDetail): Individuals or organizations who endorsed the content.\n- exposureBackground (FHIRReference): Reference to the population for the evidence.\n- exposureVariant (list of FHIRReference): References to exposures being compared.\n- identifier (list of Identifier): Additional identifiers for the evidence.\n- jurisdiction (list of CodeableConcept): Intended jurisdiction for the evidence, if applicable.\n- lastReviewDate (FHIRDate): Date when the evidence was last reviewed.\n- name (str): Computer-friendly name for the evidence.\n- note (list of Annotation): Footnotes or explanatory notes associated with the evidence.\n- outcome (list of FHIRReference): References to the outcomes addressed by the evidence.\n- publisher (str): Name of the publisher (individual or organization).\n- relatedArtifact (list of RelatedArtifact): Additional documentation or citations.\n- reviewer (list of ContactDetail): Individuals or organizations who reviewed the content.\n- shortTitle (str): Informal title for the evidence.\n- status (str): Current status of the evidence (e.g., draft, active).\n- subtitle (str): Subordinate title of the evidence.\n- title (str): Human-friendly name for the evidence.\n- topic (list of CodeableConcept): Categories of the evidence, such as Treatment or Education.\n- url (str): Canonical identifier for the evidence, represented as a globally unique URI.\n- useContext (list of UsageContext): Context intended to support the content.\n- version (str): Business version of the evidence.\n\nThis initializer also calls the parent class (DomainResource) initializer to set up inherited properties, ensuring the Evidence resource is correctly instantiated within the FHIR framework.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n# TASK DESCRIPTION:\nIn this project, you need to implement the functions and methods listed above. The functions have been removed from the code but their docstrings remain.\nYour task is to:\n1. Read and understand the docstrings of each function/method\n2. Understand the dependencies and how they interact with the target functions\n3. Implement the functions/methods according to their docstrings and signatures\n4. Ensure your implementations work correctly with the rest of the codebase\n",
